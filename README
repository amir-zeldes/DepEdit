DepEdit
=======
A simple configurable tool for manipulating dependency trees.

DepEdit reads and writes files encoded in the CoNLL dependency format (10 columns). 
It's a simple Python script which can change token attributes, token text, part of speech
dependency function and other columns, as well as rewiring dependency graphs based on rules.
